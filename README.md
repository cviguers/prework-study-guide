## Description

My motivation to move forward with this study guide was knowing I was gaining the basic skills to become a web developer so I can succeed in my bootcamp and further my career. Building this project allowed me to understand the stepping stones of HTML, CSS, Git, and JS. I was determinded to understand these basics to ensure my first days of class are successful. This project allows me to start bootcamp with a base knowledge of web development so I won't be lost on the first day of class and set up the tools on my local machine to jump right into class.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
