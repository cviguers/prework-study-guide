        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements define the content and framework of the webpage, you typically will not see this information</li>
          <li>The head element contains information (metadata) about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements within the head are not visible to consumer</li>
          <li> Elements within the body are what the consumer interacts with and sees </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Includes colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. Defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page.</li>
      <li>Makes project more readable and improve the user experience</li>
        <li>1. inline CSS style sheet: impacts an element directly in the HTML file, quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
        <li>2. internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
        <li>3. external CSS style sheet: is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
      <li>Separation of concerns - a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
      <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
      <li>Color can be assigned by name (such as blue/white) or by HEX number</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

     <ul>
      <li>JavaScript (JS) - a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
      <li>Variable (var) - a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
      <li>String - contents within the variable, always surrounded by “”</li>
      <li>Method - a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
      <li>Console.log() Method -  a test environment that developers use to check out their code, will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console</li>
      <li>Control flow - the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
      <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
      <li>for loop - uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
      <li>Function - a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file. A function's name is followed by parentheses.</li>
      <li>if statement - a way of introducing decision-making into our code (-falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. -truthy All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true)</li>
