          <li>HTML elements define the content and framework of the webpage, you typically will not see this information</li>
          <li>The head element contains information (metadata) about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements within the head are not visible to consumer</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Includes colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. Defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page.</li>
      <li>Makes project more readable and improve the user experience</li>
        <li>1. inline CSS style sheet: impacts an element directly in the HTML file, quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
        <li>2. internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
        <li>3. external CSS style sheet: is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
      <li>Separation of concerns - a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
      <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
      <li>Color can be assigned by name (such as blue/white) or by HEX number</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
